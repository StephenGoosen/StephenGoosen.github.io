### [Cybersecurity Data Analysis and Visualization](cybersecurity.html)
Extension of a University project on a real-world dataset. Written in R, this project involves a detailed and systematic approach to analyze malicious and non-malicious cybersecurity events. The process includes 
cleaning and handling data, visualizations, and principal component analysis. The dimensionality reduction of the data and the identification of important variables allows for the building of a logistic regression model to predict malicious and non-malicious events in real-time. 

### [Dog-or-not: Image Classification](https://github.com/StephenGoosen/dog-or-not)
This project involves the implementation of a binary image classification model using PyTorch. It distinguishes between images containing dogs and those that do not. The end-to-end project follows the machine learning pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model design, training, and evaluation. Which demonstrates an understanding of data augmentation, class imbalance handling, model evaluation metrics, and GPU utilization. The code is modular and reusable, and can easily be adapted for other datasets or similar image classification problems. The included inference script and app showcase the model's practical use (Example below).
