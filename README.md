### [Dog-or-not: Image Classification](https://github.com/StephenGoosen/dog-or-not)
This project involves the implementation of a binary image classification model using PyTorch. It distinguishes between images containing dogs and those that do not. The end-to-end project follows the machine learning pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model design, training, and evaluation. Which demonstrates an understanding of data augmentation, class imbalance handling, model evaluation metrics, and GPU utilization. The code is modular and reusable, and can easily be adapted for other datasets or similar image classification problems. The included inference script and app showcase the model's practical use (Example below).
