# Aspiring Data Scientist
---
Hello! I'm a data science enthusiast with a unique background in Psychological Science, which I transitioned from in 2022. This career shift has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to combine my passion for data analysis with my interest in understanding human behavior. I enjoy working with biostatistical and psychometric data as this is my subject matter passion, but have also worked with agricultural, energy, and network data. The shift to data science has equipped me with a greater set of skills in statistical methods.

I'm actively engaged with the latest developments in data science, software development, and machine learning. I have spent a lot of my time during my studies on practical implementation experience. My goal is to continue refining my expertise and advancing toward a role as a full-stack, all-rounder data scientist, contributing to impactful projects and solving real-world problems through data-driven insights. You can contact me on stephengoosen@gmail.com if you have any questions.

## Projects

### [Cybersecurity Data Analysis and Visualization](cybersecurity.html)
Written in R, this project involves a detailed and systematic approach to analyze malicious and non-malicious cybersecurity events. The process includes cleaning and handling data, visualizations, and principal component analysis. The dimensionality reduction of the data and the identification of important variables allows for the building of a logistic regression model to predict malicious and non-malicious events in real-time.

### [Natural Language Processing: Sentiment Analysis](/assets/files/twitter.pdf)
My postgraduate self-directed research project. Data was collected from both twitter and facebook on vaccine-related posts from The Australian Department of Health and Aged Care, Center from Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Health Service. NLP tools were used to predict the vaccine-stance of the posts that could then indicate public responses to different public health messaging strategies. A combined custom neural network, sentiment analysis, and topic modelling approach was used to improve model training and predictions on the limited available data.

### [Computer Vision: Object Detection](/assets/files/computer_vision.pdf)
Developed Python-based solutions using PyTorch models for accurate detection of weed and non-weed objects. Collaborated on project planning, data collection, reporting, and presentation. Lead the model building and evaluation to ensure ideal model comparisons for a robust industry-ready weed detection system.

### [Hashcast: Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/StephenGoosen/hashcast)
Django WebDev project that utilizes Yahoo Finance's yfinance API for stock price predictions. The project has two components: A stock forecast generation tool, that generates forecasts for selected stocks over specified time periods. An education section on time series forecasting in general, as well as a tutorial on how to get the most out of the generation tool.

~IN PROGRESS~

### [Dog-or-not: Image Classification](https://github.com/StephenGoosen/dog-or-not)
Project involves the implementation of a binary image classification model using PyTorch. It distinguishes between images containing dogs and those that do not. The end-to-end project follows the machine learning pipeline and demonstrates an understanding of data augmentation, class imbalance handling, model evaluation metrics, and GPU utilization. The code is modular and reusable, and can easily be adapted for other datasets or similar image classification problems. The included app showcase the model's practical use. Just pip install requirements.txt and run the app.py file.
