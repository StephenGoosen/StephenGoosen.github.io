### [Cybersecurity Data Analysis and Visualization](cybersecurity.html)
Extension of a University project on a real-world dataset. Written in R, this project involves a detailed and systematic approach to analyze malicious and non-malicious cybersecurity events. The process includes cleaning and handling data, visualizations, and principal component analysis. The dimensionality reduction of the data and the identification of important variables allows for the building of a logistic regression model to predict malicious and non-malicious events in real-time.

### [Natural Language Processing: Sentiment Analysis](/assets/files/twitter.html)
My postgraduate self-directed research project. Data was collected from both twitter and facebook on vaccine-related posts. NLP tools were used to predict the vaccine-stance of the posts that could then indicate public responses to different public health messaging strategies. A combined sentiment analysis and topic modelling approach was used to improve model training and predictions on limited available data.

### [Computer Vision: Object Detection](/assets/files/computer_vision.pdf)
Group task. 

## GitHub Projects

### [Stonks: Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/StephenGoosen/Stonks)
Django WebDev project that utilizes Yahoo Finance's yfinance API for stock price predictions. The project has two components: 1. A stock forecast generation tool, that generates forecasts for selected stocks over specified time periods. 2. An education section on time series forecasting in general, as well as a tutorial on how to get the most out of the generation tool.

### [Dog-or-not: Image Classification](https://github.com/StephenGoosen/dog-or-not)
This project involves the implementation of a binary image classification model using PyTorch. It distinguishes between images containing dogs and those that do not. The end-to-end project follows the machine learning pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model design, training, and evaluation. Which demonstrates an understanding of data augmentation, class imbalance handling, model evaluation metrics, and GPU utilization. The code is modular and reusable, and can easily be adapted for other datasets or similar image classification problems. The included inference script and app showcase the model's practical use (Example below).
