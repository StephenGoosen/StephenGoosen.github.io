## [Image Classification:](https://github.com/StephenGoosen/dog-or-not)
Dog-or-not. This project involved the implementation of a binary image classification model using PyTorch. The model was trained to distinguish between images containing dogs and those that do not. The project follows the end-to-end aspects of the machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation. The project demonstrate an understanding of data augmentation, class imbalance handling, model evaluation metrics, and GPU utlization. Additionally, it contains modular and reusable code that can be adapted to other datasets or similar image classification problems. The included inference script and inference app demonstrates the model's 'practical' use (Example below).
